## 2)the fetch-decode-execute cycle
Main memory –> Fetch instruction –> Decode instruction –> Registers –> If needed, Get data –> Execute the instruction –> Main memory
## 3)CPU registers
**IR**

In computing, an instruction register (IR) is the part of a CPU's control unit that holds the instruction currently being executed or decoded.

**PC**

The program counter (PC), is a processor register that indicates where a computer is in its program sequence.

**ACC**

In a computer's central processing unit (CPU), an accumulator is a register in which intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored.
## 4)Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine
In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.

## 1)What are stored in memory?
Datas and instructions.
## 2)Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?
Yes.
## 3)Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.
ADD #1:00010000 00000001

前八位为指令，后八位为操作数。指令第四位为寻址模式，0表示操作数为地址，1表示操作数为数值。
# Part 3 解释词汇
## 1)Assembly Language
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.
## 2)Compiler
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.
## 3)Imperative programming
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.
## 4)Functional programming
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
## 5)Procedural programming
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
