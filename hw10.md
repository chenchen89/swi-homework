# 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort the list: 33, 56, 17, 8, 95, 22。Make sure the final result is from small to large.

Write out the list after the 2nd pass.

## the first pass

8, 33, 56, 17, 22, 95.

## the second pass

8, 17, 33, 56, 22, 95.

# 2. Insert value
Give a sorted array as list={60,65,75,80,90,95}. Design an algorithm to insert the value of x into the sorted array. Then test the algorithm with value 50,67,99.

```
FOR i from len-1 to 0
    IF x<list[i] THEN
        swap(x,list[i])
    ELSE 
        BREAK
    END IF
END FOR
```

## Test



思考：为什么选择插入点在list头上、中间、尾巴上的三个数作为算法测试的数据，你能解释吗？


# 3. Stack
What is the state of the stack after the following sequence of Push and Pop operations?

Push “anne”; Push “get”; Push “your” ; Pop; Push “my” Push “gun”
