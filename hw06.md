# Homework
## 1)The von Neumann architecture
Control unit

Arithmetic/logic unit

Memory unit

Input device

Output device
## 2)
64MB=$2^{26}$byte

$\therefore$26 bits are needed.
## 3)Basic parts of a CPU
Control unit

Arithmetic/logic unit

The Cache isn't included.
## 4)Secondary storage
flash memory, optical discs, magnetic disks and magnetic tape
## 5)
### 1)CPU
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.

### 2)RAM
Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used.
### 3)ROM
Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. 
### 4)Bus (computing)
In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.
### 5)Parallel Computing
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.

## 6)Cloud computing
Cloud computing is shared pools of configurable computer system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet.
## 7)
### 1)
DDR3指第三代内存。

1333指默认工作频率是1333MHZ。
### 2)
不能

主板不支持1600MHZ，8G DDR3-1600的内存条会被识别成8G DDR3-1333，不能提高性能。
### 3)
能

主板支持双通道，频率相同时可以分别运行，能提高性能。
### 4)
16GB=$2^{34}$B

$\therefore$34 bits are needed.
